# Medarot S Parts Browser
The purpose of this project is to have a way to query the medarots data in any way possible, and secondly be a platform for more ideas to be developed, like for example, in the future I plan to make a way to compare different parts types, also apply the buffs for each part to make the comparison and queries more interesting.

# Download Executable

# Download Database
https://github.com/omitsudemon/medarot-s-query-tools/raw/main/medarot-s.db

# How to use
1) Open it. If you don't have Java installed, install it here https://www.java.com/en/download/
2) The program will look for the db, if it doesn't find the db, it will ask you for the file and save the path in a text file.
3) You can now make queries that will appear in the table below.
4) The queries are based on a stat sum (example: power + heating) so if no stat is selected, will be ordered by model.

# Other
You might want to download the database and browse it with https://sqlitebrowser.org/ so you can make your own queries there.
This project is completely open-source and made for myself and the community, so if you like it and want to support me by either letting me know if there is an error in the data, or want to contribute with more features, it will be appreciated.
